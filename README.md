# Breast-cancer-detection-using-logistic-regression
Logistic regression has many applications in data science, but in the world of healthcare, it can
really drive life-changing action.

In this SuperDataScience case study course, learn how to detect breast cancer by applying a
logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not
breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.
By the end of the course, you will be able to build a logistic regression model to identify
correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or
malignant).
• Clump thickness

• Uniformity of cell size

• Uniformity of cell shape

• Marginal adhesion

• Single epithelial cell

• Bare Nuclei

• Bland chromatin

• Normal nucleoli

• Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and
generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model
performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on
mammograms.

#Part 1: Data Preprocessing
• Importing the datase

• Splitting the dataset into a training set and test set

#Part 2: Training and Inference
• Training the logistic regression model on the training set

• Predicting the test set results

#Part 3: Evaluating the Model
• Making the confusion matrix

• Computing the accuracy with k-Fold cross-validation

More about logistic regression:


Logistic regression is a method of statistical analysis used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a dataset. A logistic regression model predicts the value of a dependent variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.
In data science, logistic regression is a Machine Learning algorithm used for classification problems and predictive analysis.
